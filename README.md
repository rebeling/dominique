# Dominique

Dominique is an AI agent that edits single pages. You click on an element, type what you want changed, and she updates the DOM directly. No backend, no preview, no UI layers. Just edit and save.

All changes are written out as static HTML. [Read more](https://rebeling.github.io/agent-rebel/projects/dominique/)
